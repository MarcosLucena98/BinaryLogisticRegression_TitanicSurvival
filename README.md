# BinaryLogisticRegression_TitanicSurvival
This code was developed for a Kaggle competition to predict Titanic passenger survival. It uses logistic regression to analyze features like age, ticket class, and family size. The model is trained on historical data and then used to predict survival on a test dataset, with performance evaluated using accuracy and recall.
